# BucketSimulation
C++ simulation of the flow of water out of holes in buckets. Created using SFML and TGUI
# About
This was my A-level Computing Coursework and was a simulation of the flow of water out of holes in buckets using numerical methods and based on Bernoulli's principle.
The Windows build is included but I believe that all dependencies were cross-platform.
